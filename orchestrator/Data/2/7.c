In C++, the `new` and `delete` operators are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, allowing for the creation and destruction of objects and variables at runtime instead of at compile time.

1. **`new` Operator**:
   - The `new` operator allocates memory on the heap for a specified type and returns a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory.
   - It also calls the constructor of the object being created (if it is a class type).
   - Syntax:
     - For a single object: `Type* ptr = new Type;`
     - For an array of objects: `Type* ptr = new Type[size];`

2. **`delete` Operator**:
   - The `delete` operator deallocates the memory that was previously allocated with `new`, releasing it back to the heap.
   - It also calls the destructor of the object (if it is a class type).
   - Syntax:
     - For a single object: `delete ptr;`
     - For an array of objects: `delete[] ptr;`

**Memory Management**:
- The use of `new` and `delete` allows for flexible memory management, enabling the allocation and deallocation of memory as needed.
- However, it requires careful management to avoid memory leaks (not freeing memory) and dangling pointers (freeing memory that is still in use).

Overall, `new` and `delete` provide powerful tools for dynamic memory management in C++, but they also impose a responsibility on the programmer to manage memory correctly.
