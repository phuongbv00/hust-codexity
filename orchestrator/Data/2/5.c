The `new` and `delete` operators in C++ are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. Here's how they work:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
   - The `new` operator allocates memory on the heap for a specified type and returns a pointer to that memory. For example:
     ```cpp
     int* ptr = new int; // allocates memory for an integer
     ```

2. **Initialization**:
   - The `new` operator can also initialize the allocated memory. For instance:
     ```cpp
     int* ptr = new int(5); // allocates memory for an integer and initializes it to 5
     ```

3. **Array Allocation**:
   - You can also allocate arrays using `new`:
     ```cpp
     int* arr = new int[10]; // allocates memory for an array of 10 integers
     ```

4. **Deallocation**:
   - The `delete` operator is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated with `new`. This helps prevent memory leaks. For example:
     ```cpp
     delete ptr; // deallocates memory for a single integer
     ```

5. **Array Deallocation**:
   - To deallocate memory allocated for an array, you use `delete[]`:
     ```cpp
     delete[] arr; // deallocates memory for an array of integers
     ```

6. **Memory Management**:
   - Using `new` and `delete` allows for more flexible memory management compared to stack allocation, which has a fixed size and lifetime. Dynamic memory remains allocated until explicitly deallocated with `delete`, allowing for the creation of data structures that can grow or shrink as needed.

Proper use of `new` and `delete` is essential to manage memory effectively and avoid issues such as memory leaks and undefined behavior due to dangling pointers.
